The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Weekly Star Tracker into an installable PWA and deployed it to Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend). Initial work involved setting up the PWA, resolving deployment issues related to  and MongoDB, and refining CORS policies. Post-deployment, the focus shifted to core application bugs and feature enhancements, including:  parameter mismatch,  errors, and intricate Tresor (safe) functionality for both task and reward stars. A significant part of the recent trajectory focused on debugging deployment inconsistencies (PWA caching,  hardcoding) and a non-responsive production backend. The AI engineer introduced a comprehensive mock API within the frontend to enable local testing and user preview despite the offline production backend, while systematically resolving numerous bugs related to star counting,  errors, incorrect star transfer logic (tasks not reducing after safe transfer), and general network errors by ensuring all frontend operations correctly used the mock API or actual backend depending on mode. The current immediate focus is to ensure the user's GitHub repository accurately reflects all these implemented fixes and new features for successful deployment.

<product_requirements>
The Weekly Star Tracker is a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for children's task management and reward systems. Key features include a customizable task table, weekly progress, a permanent Safe (Tresor) for stars, and an editable rewards system. It offers Earn Extra Stars through Math, German, and English Challenges. The primary goal was to make it an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) with robust data persistence (export/import) and a native-like user experience. Users requested difficulty adjustments for German content and granular control over star transfers to the Tresor, distinguishing between task stars and available reward stars. The initial AI-powered challenge generation was removed for simplified external hosting. The current work has focused on making the PWA functional, fixing a multitude of bugs related to star transfers (e.g., incorrect star reduction from tasks to Tresor), improving error handling (, Network Error, NaN), ensuring accurate star counting, and implementing a robust mock API for continued development and testing despite production backend issues.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, handles all backend API logic and data interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed , configured CORS, fixed  parameters. Added , , , and  endpoints. Adapted  and  to JSON request bodies, and added  for specific reward star transfers.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was removed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, orchestrates UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated  and new .  and  logic was refactored multiple times, shifting between query parameters and JSON bodies, and then completely updated to conditionally use .  calculation was fixed. Comprehensive error handling was implemented to display human-readable messages instead of  or , and to handle  issues. Star click and reward add functionalities were updated to use the mock API. Logic for  and various  functions was adapted for mock mode.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines PWA metadata (name, icons, display mode).
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created/updated with PWA icons.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Service Worker for PWA, handles caching and offline capabilities.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created. Cache names were aggressively versioned ( to ) to force updates and address PWA caching issues.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main HTML file for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added PWA meta tags and a link to .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for the React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added Service Worker registration code.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables like .
    -   **Changes Made**: Was initially set to , then hardcoded to , then toggled back to  for local testing. It is currently set back to  in the final build, but the mock API in  is designed to bypass it if  is true.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created React component for a user-friendly modal to transfer stars to the Tresor.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented with UI for task and reward star input, live summary, validation, and calls the  prop. Designed with Tailwind CSS for modern appearance.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created JavaScript file that provides an in-memory mock backend for development and testing.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains mock data for tasks, stars, progress, and rewards. It implements mock versions of , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . It includes  toggle and a  helper function to maintain consistent state for tasks, earned stars, used stars, available reward stars, and stars in the safe, including a dedicated  to accurately track and reduce task stars upon transfer to the Tresor.

<pending_tasks>
-   The main pending task is to ensure the user successfully uploads all updated frontend files (, , , potentially ) to their GitHub repository and triggers a successful deployment on Netlify (or Vercel, based on prior confusion).
-   The Render backend service () is currently offline/broken and needs to be redeployed and fixed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where Aufgaben-Sterne (task stars) were not being correctly reduced after being moved into the Tresor (safe), leading to unlimited transfers. The AI engineer identified that the  function in the  was not correctly updating the available task stars.

The fix involved:
1.  Adding a new  variable in  to specifically track user-transferred stars to the safe.
2.  Updating the  function in  to correctly subtract  from  to derive  (available task stars).
3.  Modifying  in  to increment  and , then .
4.  Updating  and  in  to correctly interact with .

This resolved the bug, ensuring task stars are correctly reduced from the available pool when moved to the safe, and transfers respect the actual available quantity.

The overall state of the application in the development environment is now fully functional with the robust mock API: task creation, star clicks, reward adding, star transfer modal, and all reset buttons work as expected without network errors. The user's challenge is to get these changes deployed to their live Netlify/Vercel site, which has been complicated by deployment platform confusion and GitHub synchronization issues. The latest action involved the user providing a GitHub URL and the AI engineer confirming the presence of  on GitHub and is about to check .
