<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Weekly Star Tracker application from conception to a fully functional state, iteratively addressing user requirements and bug reports. The process began with a comprehensive plan, prioritizing AI integration (OpenAI for math problems) as the hardest part. Upon receiving the OpenAI API key, the engineer implemented the core backend and frontend features, consistently using  for initial comprehensive writes and then  for targeted fixes and enhancements.

Key aspects of the AI engineer's approach included immediate backend testing () after significant changes, followed by user confirmation for frontend testing. Bug reports were handled systematically, with clear steps for resolution. Notable architectural decisions included using UUIDs for IDs, adhering to strict environment variable usage for URLs, and a strong emphasis on German localization and robust UI/UX (e.g., specific Tailwind CSS classes, SVG graphics for clocks, clear validation messages). The engineer also demonstrated adaptability by implementing fallback solutions (German text problem templates) when an external API limit was hit. The last set of interactions focused on thoroughly debugging and fixing critical issues in the star accounting and transfer logic, ensuring stars are only used if genuinely possessed and safe stars persist correctly.

<product_requirements>
The Weekly Star Tracker is a React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database) application designed for a child to manage weekly tasks and earn visual star rewards.

**Core Features:**
- **Custom Task Table:** User-defined tasks (rows), weekdays (columns), with 2 clickable stars per cell.
- **Progress Tracker:** Weekly progress bar (total stars collected), virtual Safe for stars (added from progress, removed from count), weekly reset (clears table/progress, but not Safe).
- **Rewards Section:** Editable reward table (e.g., Ice Cream = 5 stars), stars deducted upon claim, reward temporarily grayed out.
- **Earn Extra Stars (Math Challenges):** Submenu for Math Grade 2/3, generates configurable number of AI-powered math problems (addition/subtraction up to 100, multiplication up to x10, mixed, sister problems, word problems, clock reading via SVG, currency calculations). Automatic correction, feedback (correct/incorrect), tiered star rewards.

**Enhancements & Fixes:**
- **Star Visibility:** New tasks must show empty stars immediately.
- **Math Answer Limits:** Math answers max 100.
- **Submit Validation:** Only submit math challenge when all answers are filled.
- **Detailed Results Page:** Show all math problems with correct/incorrect answers and correct solutions.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure math inputs are 0-100, prevent invalid chars.
- **Safe Management:** Ability to open safe, view stars, and withdraw stars back to available.
- **Math Settings Menu:** Configure star rewards (tiered system), view detailed statistics (total attempts, scores, grade breakdown, answer analysis), and reset stats.
- **Localization:** Complete German translation for the entire application interface, including all prompts, labels, and messages.
- **Admin Reset Buttons:** A Reset Week button (only resets current week's stars, safe remains) and a Reset All Stars button (deletes all stars, including safe, and resets claimed rewards).
- **Rewards Delete Button:** A button to clear all rewards.
- **Configurable Math Task Count:** User can set the number of math problems generated (10-50).
- **Star System Logic Fixes:** Ensure accurate star counting, prevent transferring/using more stars than available, and correctly manage safe stars during weekly reset (they should *not* reset).

<pending_tasks>
All explicit requests and reported bugs from the user within the provided trajectory have been addressed and confirmed as fixed by the AI engineer. There are no pending tasks based on this conversation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical bugs related to the star management system. The user reported issues where:
1.  Stars could be transferred or used even if not enough were available.
2.  Star counting was incorrect.
3.  Stars in the Safe were erroneously reset during the weekly reset.

The AI engineer addressed these by:
-   **Implementing robust validation:** Ensuring users can only move or spend stars they genuinely possess, with appropriate German error messages if conditions aren't met.
-   **Refining star logic:** Correctly calculating Verfügbare Sterne (available stars) and Aufgaben-Sterne (task stars), and updating how stars are transferred to and from the Tresor (safe).
-   **Fixing weekly reset behavior:** Ensuring that stars stored in the Tresor remain unaffected by the Woche Zurücksetzen (reset week) button, only affecting task-related and available stars.

The current state of the product is fully functional and robust in its star accounting. The app now accurately tracks stars earned from tasks and math challenges, allows transfer to an available pool for rewards, and enables secure storage/withdrawal from a safe, with all operations validated and providing clear German feedback. The complex star economy is now behaving as desired, making the application reliable for its core purpose.
