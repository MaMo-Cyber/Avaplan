# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the new Safe Management and Math Settings features I just added to the Weekly Star Tracker: 1. Safe Management Testing - Look for the new 'üí∞ Safe: X ‚≠ê' button in the progress bar area, Click it to open the safe modal and verify it shows current stars in safe, Test withdrawing stars from the safe (if any are available), Verify the 'Add to Safe' functionality still works, Check that withdrawn stars are added back to weekly progress. 2. Math Settings & Statistics Testing - Look for the new '‚öôÔ∏è Math Settings' button in the tasks section, Click it to open the math settings modal, Test both tabs: '‚öôÔ∏è Settings' and 'üìä Statistics'. Settings Tab should show: Maximum number input field, Maximum multiplication table input field, Star reward tiers section with percentage thresholds, Ability to add/remove/edit star tiers, Save/Cancel buttons. Statistics Tab should show: Total attempts, average score, best score, stars earned overview cards, Grade breakdown (Grade 2 vs Grade 3 attempts), Answer breakdown (correct vs wrong answers, accuracy rate), Reset statistics button. 3. Integration Testing - Complete a math challenge and verify statistics update, Check that new star tier settings affect rewards properly, Ensure the safe and math settings work together with the existing features."

    message: "üîç WORD PROBLEMS (TEXTAUFGABEN) CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive testing per German review request revealed the exact problem with word problems functionality. ROOT CAUSE: OpenAI API quota exceeded (429 Too Many Requests), causing AI generation to fail and fall back to English simple math problems instead of German word problems. FIXES APPLIED: 1) ‚úÖ FIXED: Pydantic validation error in generate_simple_math_problems (correct_answer field expected string, got integer), 2) ‚úÖ IMPROVED: Updated system message to properly handle word problems with German story prompts. CURRENT STATUS: Settings configuration works correctly, but AI generation fails due to quota limits. System falls back to English 'What is X + Y?' problems. RECOMMENDATION: Use web search tool to find OpenAI quota solutions or implement alternative German word problem generation."
