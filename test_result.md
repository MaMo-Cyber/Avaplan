# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Fix the state management issue within the MathSettingsModal.js component to ensure the problem_count input correctly updates its internal state. The user reports that changes to settings like the number of problems are not reflected in the generated challenges. The debugging process revealed that while the settings UI works perfectly (can change problem count from 15 to 25), the actual settings are not being saved correctly due to a state management issue in the MathSettingsModal component. The root cause is in the frontend component's state management - the UI shows the new value but the settings object being passed to updateMathSettings still contains the old value. This creates a misleading user experience where settings appear to work but have zero effect on actual challenges."

    message: "üîç CHALLENGE SETTINGS FUNCTIONALITY TEST COMPLETED - MIXED RESULTS! Comprehensive testing of the Challenge Settings functionality as requested revealed both working and failing components. ‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS: 1) Admin settings modal (‚öôÔ∏è Verwaltung button) opens correctly and displays all sections including Challenge-Einstellungen, 2) Math settings modal opens successfully and displays all configuration options including 'Anzahl der Aufgaben' field, 3) Problem count can be successfully changed from default to 20 in the settings interface, 4) 'Einstellungen Speichern' button is functional and enabled, 5) Settings modal can be closed properly using Abbrechen button, 6) Math challenge can be started and grade selection works correctly. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Settings are NOT being properly applied to challenge generation! Despite successfully changing the problem count setting to 20 and saving with 'Einstellungen Speichern', the generated Math challenge only displays 3 problems instead of the expected 20. Investigation confirmed that the challenge interface shows 'Insgesamt 3 Aufgaben' (Total 3 problems) with 3 input fields for answers, indicating the backend is not respecting the saved settings configuration. This suggests a critical disconnect between the settings storage/retrieval system and the actual challenge generation logic. The UI for changing and saving settings works perfectly, but the core functionality of applying those settings to challenge generation is failing. This is a high-priority issue that prevents the settings from having any practical effect on the user experience."

    message: "üß™ MATH CHALLENGE SETTINGS TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive end-to-end testing of the Math Challenge Settings fix in Mock Mode has been completed. ‚úÖ SETTINGS UI CONFIRMED WORKING: Successfully opened admin settings, accessed math settings modal, changed problem count from 5 to 25, and saved settings. ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: The settings are NOT being applied to actual challenge generation. The math challenge shows 15 problems (default mock value from mockApi.js) instead of the configured 25 problems. üîç ROOT CAUSE: The mockApi.updateMathSettings() function updates the settings object, but the mockApi.createMathChallenge() function is not using the updated settings - it's using the original default value. This creates a broken user experience where settings appear to work but have no effect. üìä IMPACT: Demo mode users can configure settings but they're completely ignored, making the feature appear broken. The issue is in the mock API implementation, not the UI or backend integration. RECOMMENDATION: Fix the mockApi.js settings persistence to ensure updated settings are actually used by challenge generation functions."

    message: "üö® CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: MathSettingsModal State Management Bug Fix Testing Completed. The debugging logs added by main agent successfully revealed the exact issue. PROBLEM: React state management in MathSettingsModal component is broken - when user changes problem_count input from 15 to 25, the UI shows 25 but the settings object being passed to updateMathSettings still contains problem_count: 15. EVIDENCE: Console logs show 'Settings being sent to API: {problem_count: 15}' despite UI displaying 25. IMPACT: Users experience misleading behavior where settings appear to save but have zero effect on challenges. The mockApi correctly uses the received settings (15) to create exactly 15 problems instead of the expected 25. ROOT CAUSE: The onChange handler for the problem_count input field is not properly updating the React state. This is a frontend React state management issue, not a backend or API issue. RECOMMENDATION: Fix the onChange handler in MathSettingsModal component to properly update the settings state when input values change."

    message: "üîç SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION OF ALL SETTINGS ISSUES COMPLETED - MIXED RESULTS IDENTIFIED: **PART 1 - GERMAN SETTINGS**: ‚úÖ PARTIALLY WORKING - German settings modal opens correctly and shows task type options, but there's a MISMATCH between expected types (spelling, word_types, fill_blank, grammar, articles, sentence_order) and actual displayed types (spelling_problems, word_type_problems, fill_blank_problems, adjectives checkbox). Only 4 options shown instead of expected 6. Settings save successfully but limited task type selection available. **PART 2 - MATH SETTINGS**: ‚úÖ CURRENCY SETTINGS WORKING - Currency math checkbox enables properly, currency settings section appears with configurable symbol (‚Ç¨) and max amount (20.00). ‚ùå CLOCK SETTINGS UI BUG - Clock reading checkbox enables correctly but clock settings section doesn't appear in UI. However, functionality works - clock problems generate correctly. ‚ùå PROBLEM COUNT STATE BUG - UI shows changed value (25) but API receives old value (15), confirming React state management issue. **PART 3 - GRAPHICS VERIFICATION**: ‚úÖ GRAPHICS WORKING CORRECTLY - Found 8 clock time patterns (1:30, 12:30, 7:30, 6:15, 3:45) and 10 clock questions in generated challenges, confirming graphics display is functional despite user report of 'keine Grafiken angezeigt'. **SUMMARY**: User reports are PARTIALLY VALID - German settings have limited options, Math clock settings have UI issues but work functionally, currency settings work correctly, graphics are displayed properly. The main issues are UI/UX problems rather than complete functionality failures."
