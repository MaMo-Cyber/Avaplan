# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the new Safe Management and Math Settings features I just added to the Weekly Star Tracker: 1. Safe Management Testing - Look for the new 'üí∞ Safe: X ‚≠ê' button in the progress bar area, Click it to open the safe modal and verify it shows current stars in safe, Test withdrawing stars from the safe (if any are available), Verify the 'Add to Safe' functionality still works, Check that withdrawn stars are added back to weekly progress. 2. Math Settings & Statistics Testing - Look for the new '‚öôÔ∏è Math Settings' button in the tasks section, Click it to open the math settings modal, Test both tabs: '‚öôÔ∏è Settings' and 'üìä Statistics'. Settings Tab should show: Maximum number input field, Maximum multiplication table input field, Star reward tiers section with percentage thresholds, Ability to add/remove/edit star tiers, Save/Cancel buttons. Statistics Tab should show: Total attempts, average score, best score, stars earned overview cards, Grade breakdown (Grade 2 vs Grade 3 attempts), Answer breakdown (correct vs wrong answers, accuracy rate), Reset statistics button. 3. Integration Testing - Complete a math challenge and verify statistics update, Check that new star tier settings affect rewards properly, Ensure the safe and math settings work together with the existing features."

    message: "üîÑ RESET-SAFE API TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! Comprehensive testing of the new reset system per German review request confirmed all functionality working perfectly: ‚úÖ NEW RESET-SAFE API: POST /api/progress/reset-safe only resets safe stars (tested 8‚Üí0), keeps task stars (5‚Üí5) and available stars (3‚Üí3) completely unchanged as requested. ‚úÖ EXISTING RESET APIs VERIFIED: POST /api/progress/reset resets weekly task/available stars but preserves safe stars, POST /api/progress/reset-all-stars resets everything to 0. ‚úÖ DETAILED TEST SCENARIO PASSED: Successfully created test data with task stars (5), available stars (3), safe stars (8), then verified each reset type: Reset-Safe only empties safe (0) leaving others unchanged, Reset clears task+available but keeps safe, Reset-All clears everything. ‚úÖ ERROR HANDLING: Properly handles non-existent progress documents gracefully (returns 200 status). ‚úÖ RESPONSE MESSAGES: All three reset APIs return clear, descriptive messages explaining what was reset and preserved ('Safe stars reset successfully (all other stars preserved)', 'Weekly progress reset (safe stars preserved)', 'All stars reset successfully'). The new Reset-Safe functionality provides the precise control over reset behavior as requested, enabling users to selectively reset only safe stars while preserving all task and available star data. Success rate: 8/8 tests passed (100%)."

    message: "üîç STAR MOVING FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED - USER ERROR REPORT INVESTIGATED! Comprehensive testing of the star moving functionality that user reported as showing '‚ùå Fehler: [object Object]' errors. CRITICAL FINDINGS: ‚úÖ BACKEND APIs WORKING CORRECTLY: Both POST /api/progress/add-to-safe and POST /api/progress/withdraw-from-safe endpoints are fully functional with proper JSON request/response format. ‚úÖ API RESPONSE FORMAT VERIFIED: All responses are proper JSON objects, NOT [object Object] - the backend is returning correctly structured data with proper error messages in 'detail' field. ‚úÖ ERROR HANDLING WORKING: Invalid requests (too many stars) return proper 400 status codes with clear error messages like 'Not enough stars to add to safe. Available: 0, Requested: 100'. ‚úÖ JSON SERIALIZATION CONFIRMED: All API responses are properly JSON serializable with no serialization issues. ‚ùå ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The user's '‚ùå Fehler: [object Object]' error is a FRONTEND ISSUE, not backend. The backend APIs are working correctly and returning proper JSON. The issue is likely in the frontend error handling/display logic where error objects are not being properly converted to strings for display. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should investigate frontend error handling in the star moving UI components to fix the [object Object] display issue. Backend functionality is confirmed working correctly. Test results: 6/8 tests passed (75% success rate), with 2 expected failures due to test setup sequence."
